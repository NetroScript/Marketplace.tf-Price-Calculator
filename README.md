# Marketplace.tf Price Calculator
A simple price calculator on the dashboard page of marketplace.tf so you know for how much you have to sell an item if you want a specific amount of keys or how many keys you get for a specific price (Also works with just calculating the store commission).


## Installation
Use an extension which can execute userscripts (F.e. [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox))
and then install using this link: [Marketplace.tf Price Calculator.user.js](https://github.com/NetroScript/Marketplace.tf-Price-Calculator/raw/master/Marketplace.tf%20Price%20Calculator.user.js).
